# SQL Healthcare Data Analysis Project
![Healthcare Analysis](./images/healthcare_analysis.png)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of SQL for analyzing healthcare datasets with a focus on optimizing patient care and operational workflows. The analyses provide insights into various areas, including risk stratification for chronic diseases, cohort analysis for chronic disease management, and workflow optimization in healthcare settings. The results aim to support healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions that enhance patient outcomes and improve efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Risk Stratification for Diabetes**  
  Stratified patients into high, medium, and low-risk groups based on glucose levels and smoking habits, enabling targeted preventive measures for high-risk patients.

- **Chronic Disease Cohort Analysis**  
  Analyzed visit patterns for patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes to understand healthcare needs, revealing that 60% of chronic disease patients had at least two visits in the last year.

- **Healthcare Workflow Optimization**  
  Identified departments with the highest rates of late patient arrivals (cardiology and endocrinology), where 40% of appointments were late, providing actionable insights to improve patient flow and operational efficiency.

- **Readmission Analysis**  
  Pinpointed patients readmitted within 15 days for non-routine reasons, helping healthcare providers target interventions to reduce unnecessary readmissions and improve patient care.

- **Appointment Distribution Analysis**  
  Revealed peak appointment times (9 AM to 11 AM) and busiest days (Wednesdays and Thursdays), offering recommendations for better resource allocation.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing the healthcare datasets.
- **Python**: Supplementary data analysis and visualization.

## Insights
The project provided several actionable insights that can drive improvements in patient care and operational efficiency:
- 20% of patients were categorized as high-risk for diabetes, requiring targeted interventions.
- Chronic disease patients made frequent visits, highlighting the need for robust management strategies.
- Certain departments showed a higher rate of patient tardiness, which may require scheduling optimizations.
- Analyzing appointment patterns identified peak times, enabling better staff planning and resource management.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/craig2050/SQL_HealthcareEHR_DataAnalytics.git
   ```

2. Import the dataset used for this analysis (or connect to the appropriate healthcare data source).
3. Run the SQL scripts to perform the analysis:
   - `SQL_Healhcare_analytics_v1.sql`
   

4. Review the findings in the form of tables or visualizations to gain insights into patient care and operational performance.

## Conclusion
This project illustrates the powerful use of SQL in healthcare analytics, offering critical insights to optimize patient outcomes and improve the efficiency of healthcare operations. By focusing on key metrics like patient risk levels, readmission rates, and workflow efficiency, healthcare organizations can enhance both patient satisfaction and resource allocation.
